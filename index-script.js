Clearly, quality coffee is the name of the game here; after all, you can see the roaster from the entrance. A great toast menu includes the requisite avocado toast, plus a few other iterations: there's one on spelt with poached egg, radish, and Mama Lil's peppers; another, also on spelt, is topped with cashew adobo spread, pepitas, cilantro, and scallions). All told, it's a great place to work while fueling up on caffeine and enjoying a mid-morning meal, and for meeting up with clients or colleagues."

But you will be assured that it takes coffee very seriously, not only because there are three Chemex pots up on the counter—but because Coava has produced its own metal filter (to take the place of paper filters) for Chemex; you can buy one here for $50. There's a single-origin menu at the bar—choose which to have brewed (via Chemex, of course)—or go for an excellent espresso drink. For food, there are pastries from Little T, a local bakery.",

(To wit: There are Chemex coffeemakers and Hario kettles behind the counter, and roaster Matt Milletto helped found the barista school next door.) A daily Chemex menu suggests the three best roasts to try out via Chemex, though you might also try the perfectly made latte, topped with skillfully executed rosettas. You can also get a reliably delicious breakfast and lunch here. The options—avo toast, yogurt with cacao nib granola, and a few different kinds of bowls—skew simple and vegetable-heavy."

Oh, and the amazing PB&J, which along with a hazelnut espresso coffee cake, comprises the very limited (but very delicious) food menu. You can also get a baguette or toast with butter and jam."

Beyond the atmosphere, Ristretto is a coffee nerd's dream. You can get your single origin in an Aeropress or a blend in a French Press. Latte art is beautifully creative here, often with two designs in one foamy, frothy creation. Pastries and cookies are from Bakeshop, Kim Boyce's fabulous whole grain bakery; the blueberry bran muffin is moist, flavorful, and not too sweet."

It has three roasts available at all times; say, Barista's own brew, one from 49th Parallel in Vancouver, B.C., and another from Kickapoo in Wisconsin. You can order classic coffee drinks, but tryto go for something interesting, like the Oregon hazelnut latte or the chai latte, made with gingery Tanglewood chai."

The roaster is visible from the street, indicating that this is clearly a spot that takes coffee seriously—though it also serves stronger stuff, with a few cocktails and wines available by the glass. If you can, head here for breakfast: Much to the delight of movie fans, the menu is Princess Bride-themed, with items like Fred Savage Toast (avocado on multigrain toast), Buttercup Toast (multigrain toast topped with butter, almond butter, cranberry apple butter, cardamom candied almonds, and sea salt) and The Humperdinck (vegan apple sage sausage, dijon mustard, pickled peppers, walnut pesto, and red onion beet relish on a potato bun)."
